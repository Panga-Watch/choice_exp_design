**Summary:**

This is a script that is used to design our choice experiment using a full factorial design. The result of this script produces a .csv file which will have a full factorial design which can be used to implement choice experiments with different packages. Packages required for this script include tidyverse and AlgDesign.


**Data Source:**

There is no data source for this script. 
 
**Reference:**

[This paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b0fb/05e51e02d4eda914888ae0590dd65b45ff9a.pdf) was instrumental in designing our choice experiment. It explains how to use R to design a full factorial design. 
 
**Methods:**

All R code used to generate our design can be found in "exp_design.Rmd".
